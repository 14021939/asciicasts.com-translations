<p>In this Rails application we have a <code>Project</code> model which <code>has_many</code> tasks:</p>
<pre class="ruby">
class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :tasks
end
</pre>
<p>and a <code>Task</code> model which <code>belongs_to</code> a project:</p>
<pre class="ruby">
class Task &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :project
end
</pre>
<p>In the project&rsquo;s controller method is a <code>show</code> action. We want to display a <code>Project</code>, along with all of the <code>Task</code>s in the project which are incomplete. To do this we perform a <code>find</code> on the <code>Task</code> model to find tasks where the <code>project_id</code> matches the <code>Project</code>&rsquo;s id and where the <code>complete</code> field is <code>false</code>:</p>
<pre class="ruby">
class ProjectsController &lt; ApplicationController
    def show
        @project = Project.find(params[:id])
        @tasks = Task.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; ['project_id = ? AND complete = ?', @project.id, false])
    end
end
</pre>
<p>There is a better way to do this. A <code>find</code> can be performed through an association. The line above that finds that tasks can be changed from</p>
<pre class="ruby">@tasks = Task.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; ['project_id = ? AND complete = ?', @project.id, false])</pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre class="ruby">@tasks = @project.tasks.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; [complete = ?', false])</pre>
<p>This means that the <code>project_id</code> can be removed from the <code>find</code> as it&rsquo;s already specified by doing the find through the project&rsquo;s tasks.</p>
<p>This line can be shortened even more by using a dynamic find method in the scope of the project model to this:</p>
<pre class="ruby">@tasks = @project.tasks.find_all_by_complete(false)</pre>
