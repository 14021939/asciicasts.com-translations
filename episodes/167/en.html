<p>Virtual attributes were first covered back in Episode 16. If you&rsquo;re unfamiliar with them then you should <a href="http://asciicasts.com/episodes/16-virtual-attributes">read</a> or <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/16-virtual-attributes">watch</a> that episode first as it will help you understand this one. Virtual attributes are a great help if you have to deal with complex forms, in which the fields don&rsquo;t map cleanly onto your model&rsquo;s attributes.</p>

<p>In this episode we&rsquo;ll combine virtual attributes with a callback to add tagging to a blogging application. We&rsquo;ll start with a basic app that has a number of articles.</p>

</div>

<p>What we&rsquo;d like to do is add the ability to tag to a new article, adding either new or existing tags by specifying them in a text field. There are a number of tagging plugins available for Rails that we could use, but we&rsquo;re going to create our solution from scratch to show how easy it is to do this by making use of virtual attributes.</p>

<h3>Creating The Models</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ll start by creating a <code>Tag</code> model. This is a simple model that has just one attribute, <code>name</code>.</p>
<pre class="terminal">
script/generate model tag name:string
</pre>
<p>There will have to be an association between the <code>Tag</code> and <code>Article</code> models. As an article can have many tags and a tag can belong to many articles it will have to be a many-to-many relationship. We&rsquo;ll create a join model for this which we&rsquo;ll called <code>Tagging</code>. This model will just have two integer fields, <code>article_id</code> and <code>tag_id</code>, that will be foreign keys on the <code>Article</code> and <code>Tag</code> models.</p>
<pre class="terminal">
script/generate model tagging article_id:integer tag_id:integer
</pre>
<p>To complete the creation of our two new models we just need to run the newly created migrations.</p>
<pre class="terminal">
rake db:migrate
</pre>
<p>Next we&rsquo;ll quickly define the relationships in the models themselves. <code>Tagging</code> will <code>belong_to</code> both <code>Article</code> and <code>Tag</code>.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
class Tagging &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  belongs_to :article
  belongs_to :tag
end
</pre>
<p><code>Tag</code> needs to have a <code>has_many :though</code> relationship with <code>Article</code>.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
class Tag &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :taggings, :dependent =&gt; :destroy
  has_many :articles, :through =&gt; :taggings
end
</pre>
<p>Likewise <code>Article</code> will have a similar relationship with <code>Tag</code>.</p>
<pre class="terminal">
class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :comments, :dependent =&gt; :destroy
  has_many :taggings, :dependent =&gt; :destroy
  has_many :tags, :through =&gt; :taggings
  validates_presence_of :name, :content
end
</pre>
<p>Note the use of <code>:dependent =&gt; :destroy</code> in both <code>Tag</code> and <code>Article</code>. This will ensure that any <code>Taggings</code> that are no longer needed will be removed when a <code>Tag</code> or <code>Article</code> is destroyed.</p>

<h3>The View</h3>

<p>With the models in place we can now alter the new article view to add a text field where we can add a space-separated list of the tags that we want to associate with the article. Because we&rsquo;re converting the text from the field into an association the cleanest way to do this will be to use a virtual attribute.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
&lt;% form_for @article do |form| %&gt;
  &lt;ol class=&quot;formList&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;%= form.label :name, &quot;Name&quot; %&gt;
      &lt;%= form.text_field :name %&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;%= form.label :tag_names, &quot;Tags&quot; %&gt;
      &lt;%= form.text_field :tag_names %&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;%= form.label :content, &quot;Content&quot; %&gt;
      &lt;%= form.text_area :content, :rows =&gt; 10 %&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;
      &lt;%= form.submit &quot;Submit&quot; %&gt;
    &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</pre>
<p class="title">The new article form with the <code>tag_names</code> field added.</p>

<p>Our <code>Article</code> model doesn&rsquo;t have a <code>tag_names</code> attribute so we&rsquo;ll create a virtual attribute to represent the string of tags that is assigned to an article. Previously we&rsquo;ve used getter and setter methods to create virtual attributes. For our <code>Article</code> model we could create a <code>tag_names=</code> method and use that to set the article&rsquo;s tags. There are disadvantages to this approach though, one of which is that creating the tags in the setter method will create <code>Tagging</code> records every time the attribute has its value set, whether the article itself is saved or not.</p>

<p>A better way to do this is by using a callback. An <code>after_save</code> callback in <code>Article</code> will ensure that only when an article is saved are its tags saved. The model will now look like this:</p>
<pre class="ruby">
class Article &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :comments, :dependent =&gt; :destroy
  has_many :taggings, :dependent =&gt; :destroy
  has_many :tags, :through =&gt; :taggings
  validates_presence_of :name, :content

  attr_accessor :tag_names
  after_save :assign_tags

  private
  def assign_tags
    if @tag_names
      self.tags = @tag_names.split(/\s+/).map do |name|
        Tag.find_or_create_by_name(name)
      end
    end
  end

end
</pre>
<p>Note that we still need getter and setter methods for the virtual <code>tag_names</code> attribute, but that this is now done with an accessor. The private <code>assign_tags</code> method that is called after the article is saved first checks that <code>@tag_names</code> is not <code>nil</code> and if it isn&rsquo;t splits its value at any spaces it finds to create an array. It then uses <code>map</code> to iterate over the array and returns a <code>Tag</code> for each value. It does this by using the <code>find_or_create_by_name</code> method to return a <code>Tag</code> with a given name, creating it first if it doesn&rsquo;t exist. Finally we assign the array of <code>Tags</code> to the <code>Article</code>&rsquo;s <code>tags</code> attribute.</p>

<p>Having made the changes to our model class we can now test our code by adding a new article and giving it some tags.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/132/original/E167I02.png" width="808" height="536" alt="Adding a new article with tags."/>
</div>

<p>Once we&rsquo;ve added the article we can use the Rails console to see if its tags have been added correctly.</p>
<pre class="terminal">
&gt;&gt; a = Article.last
=&gt; #&lt;Article id: 3, name: &quot;New Article&quot;, content: &quot;I am a new article.&quot;, author_name: nil, created_at: &quot;2009-06-24 20:38:56&quot;, updated_at: &quot;2009-06-24 20:38:56&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt; a.tags
=&gt; [#&lt;Tag id: 1, name: &quot;stuff&quot;, created_at: &quot;2009-06-24 20:38:56&quot;, updated_at: &quot;2009-06-24 20:38:56&quot;&gt;, #&lt;Tag id: 2, name: &quot;things&quot;, created_at: &quot;2009-06-24 20:38:56&quot;, updated_at: &quot;2009-06-24 20:38:56&quot;&gt;]
</pre>
<p>They have! Two new tags have been created and have been associated with our article. We&rsquo;re not quite finished yet though. If we try to edit our article its Tags field will be blank.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/133/original/E167I03.png" width="808" height="536" alt="The tags field is not repopulated when the article is invalid."/>
</div>

<p>To fix this we need to update the <code>Article</code> model and write a getter method for <code>tag_names</code> that will return an article&rsquo;s tags&rsquo; names as a string. As we&rsquo;re adding an explicit getter method we&rsquo;ll also have to replace our <code>attr_accessor</code> with an <code>attr_writer</code>.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
def tag_names
  @tag_names || tags.map(&amp;:name).join(&#x27; &#x27;)
end
</pre>
<p>The method above will return the <code>@tag_names</code> instance variable if it has already been assigned; otherwise it will return a string of all of the article&rsquo;s tags&rsquo; names separated by a space.</p>

<h3>Working With Validators</h3>

<p>Another advantage of this approach is that it works well with validators. If we add another tag but make the form invalid by removing the content, an error message will be shown and the content of the Tags field will be maintained in the form.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/134/original/E167I04.png" width="808" height="627" alt="The tags field now has its value maintained when the form in invalid."/>
</div>

<p>As we&rsquo;ve used an <code>after_save</code> callback the new tag &ldquo;etc&rdquo; won&rsquo;t be created as the article wasn&rsquo;t saved. The tag and association will only be created when the form is valid and the article is saved.</p>

<p>We now have the ability to tag our articles simply. The combination of virtual attributes and callbacks is well worth using in your applications when your forms become complex or have fields from associated models.</p>
