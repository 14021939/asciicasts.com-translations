<p>The first beta of Rails 3.1 has just been released and over the next few episodes we&rsquo;ll covering some of its new features. We&rsquo;ll start this time by showing how to get it set up on and then giving an overview of some of the new functionality it offers.</p> 

<h3>Installing Rails 3.1</h3>

<p>Before we install the Rails 3.1 beta gem we&rsquo;ll use rvm to create a gemset so that we can isolate the install from the rest of our environment and use it without affecting our Rails 3.0 installation. We can create a gemset called <code>railspre</code> by running this command:</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ rvm 1.9.2@railspre --create</pre>

<p>We can then install the Rails beta under that gemset by running</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ gem install rails --pre</pre>

<p>This will install a number of gems and once they&rsquo;re all installed we can check our Rails version to make sure that everything has installed correctly.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ rails -v
Rails 3.1.0.beta1</pre>

<p>Now that we have the beta installed we can create our first Rails 3.1 application.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ rails new todo</pre>

<p>Rails 3.1 uses jQuery as its default JavaScript library. If we want to create a new application that uses Prototype we can use the <code>-j</code> option to do this.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ rails new todo -j prototype</pre>

<p>Before we start to look at our new application we&rsquo;ll <code>cd</code> to its directory and run <code>bundle</code> to install the application&rsquo;s gems. After they have installed we can take a look at the application&rsquo;s structure.</p>

<p>This is how the directory structure looks in TextMate. (Note that we&rsquo;re using the <a href="https://github.com/jezdez/textmate-missingdrawer">MissingDrawer</a> plugin here to show the directory structure in a sidebar rather than as the default drawer.)</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/657/original/E265I01.png" width="796" height="392" alt="The Rails 3.1 directory structure viewed in TextMate."/>
</div>

<p>We&rsquo;ll take a look at the <code>Gemfile</code> first. Here it is:</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/Gemfile</p>
<pre class="ruby">source &#x27;http://rubygems.org&#x27;

gem &#x27;rails&#x27;, &#x27;3.1.0.beta1&#x27;

# Bundle edge Rails instead:
# gem &#x27;rails&#x27;,     :git =&gt; &#x27;git://github.com/rails/rails.git&#x27;

gem &#x27;sqlite3&#x27;

# Asset template engines
gem &#x27;sass&#x27;
gem &#x27;coffee-script&#x27;
gem &#x27;uglifier&#x27;

gem &#x27;jquery-rails&#x27;

# Use unicorn as the web server
# gem &#x27;unicorn&#x27;

# Deploy with Capistrano
# gem &#x27;capistrano&#x27;

# To use debugger
# gem &#x27;ruby-debug19&#x27;, :require =&gt; &#x27;ruby-debug&#x27;

group :test do
  # Pretty printed test output
  gem &#x27;turn&#x27;, :require =&gt; false
end</pre>

<p>The first few lines of the file don&rsquo;t contain any surprises, but then we come to a section marked &ldquo;Asset template engines&rdquo;.  Rails now comes with <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a> and <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/">CoffeeScript</a> enabled by default and we&rsquo;ll explore these more in future episodes. This section also contains a gem called <a href="https://github.com/lautis/uglifier">Uglifier</a> which minifies the application&rsquo;s JavaScript code in production mode and the jquery-rails gem. If we were using Prototype then this would be prototype-rails instead.</p> 

<p>At the bottom of the file is a reference to the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/turn">turn</a> gem which makes test output prettier and which we&rsquo;ll cover a little later.</p> 

<h3>Template Changes</h3>

<p>The biggest change here is in how assets are handled by the template engines. If we open up the application&rsquo;s <code>/public</code> directory we&rsquo;ll see that the <code>javascripts</code> and <code>stylesheets</code> directories are no longer there.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/658/original/E265I02.png" width="803" height="507" alt="The public directory no longer has javascripts and stylesheets directories."/>
</div>

<p>If these directories have gone, where should we put our JavaScript and CSS code? The answer is that they now go in the new <code>/app/assets</code> directory. If we open the <code>javascripts</code> directory here we&rsquo;ll see an <code>application.js</code> file but if we look at it we&rsquo;ll see that this isn&rsquo;t where we&rsquo;re supposed to put the application&rsquo;s JavaScript code.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/assets/javascripts/application.js</p>
<pre class="javascript">// FIXME: Tell people that this is a manifest file, real code should go into discrete files
// FIXME: Tell people how Sprockets and CoffeeScript works
//
//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require_tree .</pre>

<p>This file is designed to be a manifest file. Instead of writing JavaScript code in here it should be placed in other files in the same directory. To get an idea as to how this should work we&rsquo;ll generate a scaffold in our application for a <code>Project</code>.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ rails g scaffold project name:string</pre>

<p>If we look at the output from this command we&rsquo;ll see that some files have been generated in the <code>app/assets</code> directory.</p>
<pre class="terminal">      create  app/assets/stylesheets/scaffold.css.scss
      invoke  assets
      create    app/assets/javascripts/projects.js.coffee
      create    app/assets/stylesheets/projects.css.scss</pre>

<p>The files include a CSS file, but with an extension of <code>.scss</code> and a JavaScript file with a <code>.coffee</code> extension. We&rsquo;ll take a look at these files shortly but first we&rsquo;ll migrate the database so that the new <code>projects</code> table is created.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ rake db:migrate</pre>

<p>The generated SCSS files look much like standard CSS at first glance, but if we look towards the bottom we&rsquo;ll see some differences, including nested rules. This is a SASS-specific feature and we&rsquo;ll be taking a closer look at SASS in a future episode.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/assets/stylesheets/scaffold.css.scss</p>
<pre class="css">#error_explanation {
  width: 450px;
  border: 2px solid red;
  padding: 7px;
  padding-bottom: 0;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  
  h2 {
    text-align: left;
    font-weight: bold;
    padding: 5px 5px 5px 15px;
    font-size: 12px;
    margin: -7px;
    margin-bottom: 0px;
    background-color: #c00;
    color: #fff;
  }
  
  ul li {
    font-size: 12px;
    list-style: square;
  }
}</pre>

<p>The scaffold has also generated a <code>projects.css.scss</code> file for CSS specific to the <code>Projects</code> pages and a <code>projects.js.coffee</code> file for projects-related JavaScript. Note that this is only a recommendation, all of the CSS and JavaScript files are loaded for every page as they&rsquo;re all bundled into one JavaScript and one CSS file.</p>

<p>If we start up our application&rsquo;s server and visit the projects page we&rsquo;ll see in the page&rsquo;s source that two files are included.</p>

<pre class="html">&lt;link href=&quot;/assets/application.css&quot; media=&quot;screen&quot; &crarr;
  rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; /&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;/assets/application.js&quot; type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt; &crarr;
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<p>These two files contain bundled-up versions of the application&rsquo;s JavaScript and CSS files and the contents of these files are based on the <code>require</code> lines in the <code>application.js</code> and <code>application.css</code> files. These lines determine which files are included and the order they&rsquo;re added into the combined file.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/assets/javascripts/application.js</p>
<pre class="javascript">//= require jquery
//= require jquery_ujs
//= require_tree .</pre>

<p>Behind the scenes Rails uses <a href="http://www.getsprockets.com/">Sprockets</a> to accomplish this. Sprockets takes all of the JavaScript or CSS files in an application and merges them into a single file that&rsquo;s delivered to the client. This means that we can arrange the files in our application however we like and they&rsquo;ll be combined into a single file. In production mode the files will be minified so that they can be downloaded as efficiently as possible.</p>

<p>In development mode the <code>application.js</code> and <code>application.css</code> files are reloaded automatically while in production mode they&rsquo;re cached so there&rsquo;s no decrease in performance while the CoffeeScript and SASS files are compiled.</p> 

<h3>Changes to Migrations</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the other new features in Rails 3.1, starting with the database migration file that was generated with the scaffold we created earlier.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/db/migrate/20110511193808_create_projects.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">class CreateProjects &lt; ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :projects do |t|
      t.string :name

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end</pre>

<p>This migration is different from what we&rsquo;re used to: instead of the usual <code>up</code> and <code>down</code> methods there&rsquo;s just a single <code>change</code> method to handle the up and down migrations. In Rails 3.1 there&rsquo;s no need to write both methods as long as they can be determined from the change method. This is a nice addition to ActiveRecord that will save time when creating migration code.</p>

<h3>Identity Maps</h3>

<p>Identity Maps are another great new addition to ActiveRecord. If we take a look at the <code>application.rb</code> configuration file we&rsquo;ll see that they&rsquo;re enabled by default.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/config/application.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby"># Enable IdentityMap for Active Record, &crarr;
to disable set to false or remove the line below.
config.active_record.identity_map = true</pre>

<p>To get this working in the first beta of Rails 3.1 it might be necessary to hack this config file a little by adding another line of code.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/config/application.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby"># Enable IdentityMap for Active Record, &crarr;
to disable set to false or remove the line below.
config.active_record.identity_map = true
ActiveRecord::IdentityMap.enabled = true</pre>

<p>What does the IdentityMap feature give us? To demonstrate it we&rsquo;ll use it in the console. First we&rsquo;ll create a new <code>Project</code>.</p>

<pre class="terminal">&gt; p = Project.create!(:name =&gt; &quot;Yardwork&quot;)
  SQL (81.4ms)  INSERT INTO &quot;projects&quot; (&quot;created_at&quot;, &quot;name&quot;, &quot;updated_at&quot;) VALUES (?, ?, ?)  [[&quot;created_at&quot;, Fri, 13 May 2011 18:41:25 UTC +00:00], [&quot;name&quot;, &quot;Yardwork&quot;], [&quot;updated_at&quot;, Fri, 13 May 2011 18:41:25 UTC +00:00]]
 =&gt; #&lt;Project id: 1, name: &quot;Yardwork&quot;, created_at: &quot;2011-05-13 18:41:25&quot;, updated_at: &quot;2011-05-13 18:41:25&quot;&gt;</pre> 
 
<p>The first thing to note is that the log is shown directly in the console so that we know exactly what SQL is being executed inline when the command is run.</p>

<p>Next we&rsquo;ll fetch the newly-created <code>Project</code> by its <code>id</code>.</p>
<pre class="terminal">ruby-1.9.2-p180 :002 &gt; p1 = Project.find(1)
  Project Loaded  From Identity Map (id: 1)
 =&gt; #&lt;Project id: 1, name: &quot;Yardwork&quot;, created_at: &quot;2011-05-13 18:41:25&quot;, updated_at: &quot;2011-05-13 18:41:25&quot;&gt;</pre> 
 
<p>Note that in the console it says <code>Project Loaded From Identity Map (id: 1)</code>. No SQL query is run to fetch the project from the database, Rails knows that that project is already loaded into memory and will use that exact instance. We can confirm this by checking that both the Project&rsquo;s have the same <code>object_id</code>.</p>

<pre class="terminal">ruby-1.9.2-p180 :006 &gt; p.object_id == p1.object_id
 =&gt; true</pre>
 
<p>This means that we won&rsquo;t have any problems when we&rsquo;re setting attributes on one record and think that it&rsquo;s the same record that we&rsquo;re loading through an association. We can guarantee that it&rsquo;ll be the same instance now.</p>

<h3>Nested has_many :through Associations</h3>

<p>There are a number of other new additions to ActiveRecord, such as nested <code>has_many :through</code> associations. Take a look at the following model code.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/models/project.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  has_many :tasks
  has_many :assignments, :through =&gt; :tasks
  has_many :users, :through =&gt; :assignments
end</pre>

<p>In earlier versions of Rails we couldn&rsquo;t do this but in version 3.1 we can now nest <code>has_many :through</code> associations, which will come in useful in many situations.</p>

<p>Another new feature is the ability to assign roles to <code>attr_accessible</code> calls. For example we could make the <code>name</code> attribute accessible, but only to users in the admin role.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/models/project.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">class Project &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :name, :as =&gt; :admin
end</pre>

<p>If we try to modify the <code>Project</code> we created in the console through the browser by changing its name from &ldquo;Yardwork&rdquo; to &ldquo;Housework&rdquo; the name won&rsquo;t change as we&rsquo;re not logged in as an admin.</p>

<div class="imageWrapper">
  <img src="/system/photos/659/original/E265I03.png" width="801" height="280" alt="The change isn't made as we aren't in the appropriate role."/>
</div>

<p>We pass in roles through the controller, modifying the call to <code>update_attributes</code> with an <code>:as</code> option.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/app/controllers/projects_controller.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">def update
  @project = Project.find(params[:id])

  respond_to do |format|
    if @project.update_attributes(params[:project], :as =&gt; :admin)
      format.html { redirect_to @project, notice: &#x27;Project &crarr;
          was successfully updated.&#x27; }
      format.json { head :ok }
    else
      format.html { render action: &quot;edit&quot; }
      format.json { render json: @project.errors, &crarr;           
        status: :unprocessable_entity }
    end
  end
end</pre>

<p>If we try to update a <code>Project</code> through the form now it will work as we have the <code>admin</code> role.</p> 

<h3>View Layer Changes</h3>

<p>We&rsquo;ll finish off by showing some changes to the view layer. The first is small, but useful. Until now, if we have a <code>file_field</code> in a form we have to add <code>:html =&gt; { :multipart =&gt; :true }</code> to <code>form_for</code> so that any uploaded files were sent correctly. In Rails 3.1 there&rsquo;s no need to do this and the correct <code>enctype</code> attribute is added to the opening <code>form</code> tag when the form contains a <code>file_field</code>.</p>

<p>Another new feature is a change to links. We can now pass in domain and subdomain options to URL helpers. Say that we have this code for a link:</p>

<pre class="ruby">&lt;%= link_to &#x27;Edit&#x27;, edit_project_path(@project) %&gt;</pre>

<p>If we want these edit links to point to a different subdomain we can change this code as follows:</p>
<pre class="ruby">&lt;%= link_to &#x27;Edit&#x27;, edit_project_url(@project, &crarr;
  :subdomain =&gt; &#x27;foo&#x27;) %&gt;</pre>

<p>The link will now point to the same page on the <code>foo</code> subdomain.</p>

<h3>Better Test Output</h3>

<p>Finally we&rsquo;ll take a look at the improved test output. If we run <code>rake test</code> the output is cleaner and prettier as it uses the turn gem that we saw earlier in the <code>Gemfile</code>.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ rake test

<p>There are are many more new features in Rails 3.1 that we haven&rsquo;t covered here. Automated streaming, view inheritance, mountable engines and so much more and we&rsquo;ll be covering these and more in future episodes.</p>
