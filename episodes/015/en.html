<p>This episode discusses <code>find</code> conditions. Below are some lines from <code>script/console</code>, shown with the SQL that they generate.</p>
<code class="terminal">Task.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; ["completed = ? AND priority = ?", false, 2])</code>
<code class="sql">SELECT * FROM "tasks" WHERE (completed = 'f' AND priority = 2)</code>
<p class="title">Finding all uncompleted tasks with a priority of 2.</p>

<p>The example above works, but what if we&rsquo;re looking for the <code>Tasks</code> that have a <code>priority</code> that is <code>nil</code>?
<code class="terminal">Task.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; ["completed = ? AND priority = ?", false, nil])</code>
<code class="sql">SELECT * FROM "tasks" WHERE (completed = 'f' AND priority = NULL) </code>
<p class="title">Searching for null values generates incorrect <span class="caps">SQL</span>.</p>

<p>The SQL generated above is incorrect. When searching for null values the correct syntax would be <code>priority IS NULL</code>, not <code>priority = NULL</code>. Similarly if we were searching for more than one priority value using an array or range we&rsquo;d have to change the find string to use <code>IN</code> rather than <code>=</code>, and put brackets around the second question mark in order to ensure that the SQL generated had the correct syntax.</p>
<code class="terminal">Task.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; ["completed = ? AND priority IN (?)", false, [1,3]])</code>
<code class="sql">SELECT * FROM "tasks" WHERE (completed = 'f' AND priority IN (1,3))</code>
<p class="title"></p>

<p>Since Rails 1.2 there has been a better way to pass conditions: via a hash. Using a hash of conditions ensures that Rails uses the correct conditions when querying the database.</p>
<code class="terminal">Task.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; { :completed =&gt; false, priority =&gt; [1,3] }</code>
<code class="sql">SELECT * FROM "tasks" WHERE (completed = 'f' AND priority IN (1,3)</code>
<p class="title">Using a hash of conditions with an array parameter.</p>

<code class="terminal">Task.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; {:completed =&gt; false, priority =&gt; 2..4})</code><code class="sql">SELECT * FROM "tasks" WHERE ("tasks"."priority" BETWEEN 2 AND 4 AND "tasks"."completed" = 'f') </code>
<p class="title">Pass a range and <code>BETWEEN</code> will be used in the <span class="caps">SQL</span>.</p>

<h3>Using with dynamic finds</h3>
<p>Back in <a href="/episodes/2-dynamic-find-by-methods">episode 2</a> we used dynamic <code>find_by</code> methods. These can also take nil, array or range arguments.</p>
<code class="terminal">Task.find_by_priority(1..5)</code><code class="sql">SELECT * FROM "tasks" WHERE ("tasks"."priority" BETWEEN 1 AND 5) LIMIT 1</code>

<p>Using a hash of find conditions ensures that Rails generates the correct <span class="caps">SQL</span> when passing any type of parameter to the find.</p>
