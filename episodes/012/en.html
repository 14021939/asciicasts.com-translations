<p>The <a href="/episodes/10-refactoring-user-name-part-1">last</a> <a href="/11-refactoring-user-name-part-2">two</a> episodes have concentrated on refactoring and testing. By the end of the last episode we&rsquo;d refactored our model, but the tests for it were in a bit of a mess. Let&rsquo;s see what we can do to tidy them up.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
  require 'test_helper'
  class UserTest &lt; ActiveSupport::TestCase
    test "full name without middle initial" do
      user = User.new(:first_name =&gt; "John", :last_name =&gt; "Smith")
      assert_equal 'John Smith', user.full_name
    end

    test "full name with middle initial" do
      user = User.new(:first_name =&gt; "Paul", :middle_initial =&gt; "P", :last_name =&gt; "Hughes")
      assert_equal 'Paul P. Hughes', user.full_name
    end

    test "full name with empty middle initial" do
      user = User.new(:first_name =&gt; "John", :middle_initial =&gt; "", :last_name =&gt; "Jones")
      assert_equal 'John Jones', user.full_name
    end
  end
</pre>
<p class="title">The tests for the <code>User</code> class.</p>
<p>We have three tests and there is a lot of duplication across them. For each test we create a new <code>User</code> and compare it to a string value. To remove the duplication we&rsquo;ll create a method that creates a new <code>User</code> and returns its <code>full_name</code>.</p>
<pre class="ruby">
def full_name(first, middle, last)
  User.new(:first_name =&gt; first, :middle_initial =&gt; middle, :last_name =&gt; last).full_name
end
</pre>
<p class="title">The new non-test method for the <code>UserTest</code> class.</p>
<p>Now, each of our tests can be simplified so that they look like this:</p>
<pre class="ruby">
test "full name without middle initial" do
  assert_equal "John Smith", full_name('John', nil, 'Smith')
end

test "full name with middle initial" do
  assert_equal 'Paul P. Hughes', full_name('Paul', 'P', 'Hughes')
end  

test "full name with empty middle initial" do
  assert_equal "John Jones", full_name('John', '', 'Jones')
end
</pre>
<p class="title">The simplified test for a <code>User</code> with a middle initial.</p>
<p>Of course, the proof that our refactoring has worked is that the tests still all pass.</p>

3 tests, 3 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors

<p class="title">The refactored unit tests still pass.</p>
<p>Now that our tests are straightforward they can be moved in to a single test with three assertions. The only problem with doing that is that if one of the assertions in a test fails it is difficult to know which one it was. We can add a message to each assertion so that it identifies itself if it fails. Our final test class looks like this:</p>
<pre class="ruby">
require 'test_helper'

class UserTest &lt; ActiveSupport::TestCase
  test "full name" do
    assert_equal "John Smith", full_name('John', nil, 'Smith'), 'nil middle initial'
    assert_equal 'Paul P. Hughes', full_name('Paul', 'P', 'Hughes'), 'P middle initial'
    assert_equal "John Jones", full_name('John', '', 'Jones'), 'blank middle initial'
  end

  def full_name(first, middle, last)
    User.new(:first_name =&gt; first, :middle_initial =&gt; middle, :last_name =&gt; last).full_name
  end
end
</pre>
<p class="title">The final refactored <code>UserTest</code> class.</p>
<p>Over the last three episodes we&rsquo;ve created unit tests and refactored them along with the code they test to leave both in a much more readable and managable state. While this is a relatively simple example it should persuade you of the benefits of testing and refactoring your Ruby and Rails code.</p>
