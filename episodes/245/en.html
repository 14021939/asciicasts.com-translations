<p>The way that Ruby gems are created and managed has evolved over the years. Back in episode 135 [<a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/135-making-a-gem">watch</a>, <a href="http://asciicasts.com/episodes/135-making-a-gem">read</a>] we used the echoe gem to create a gem; about a year later in episode 183 [<a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/183-gemcutter-jeweler">watch</a>, <a href="http://asciicasts.com/episodes/183-gemcutter-jeweler">read</a>] we used Jeweler. Both of these tools offer ways to generate Gemspec files for each release of a gem and the Gemspec file is managed with that tool. This time we&rsquo;re going to manage the Gemspec file manually using a method that is much simpler overall.</p>

<p>With this method we still need to create the initial Gemspec file for each of our gems. We could do this manually or we could use a tool like Bundler to help us. Bundler is generally thought of as a way of managing an application&rsquo;s dependencies but it also has a little-known command for creating gems that works very well. That command is <code>bundle gem</code> and we pass it the name of the gem that we want to create. For the purposes of this episode we&rsquo;re going to create a simple gem called lorem that generates some &ldquo;Lorem ipsum&rdquo; text.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ bundle gem lorem
      create  lorem/Gemfile
      create  lorem/Rakefile
      create  lorem/.gitignore
      create  lorem/lorem.gemspec
      create  lorem/lib/lorem.rb
      create  lorem/lib/lorem/version.rb
Initializating git repo in /Users/eifion/code/ep245/lorem</pre>

<p>The <code>bundle gem</code> command creates a new directory and generates several files in it. It also initializes a git repository there. This assumes that you&rsquo;re using git and we&rsquo;ll explain why it does this shortly. Before we do that we&rsquo;ll walk you through some of the generated files, starting with the <code>lorem.gemspec</code> file.</p> 

<p class="codeFilePath">/lorem/lorem.gemspec</p>
<pre class="ruby"># -*- encoding: utf-8 -*-
$:.push File.expand_path(&quot;../lib&quot;, __FILE__)
require &quot;lorem/version&quot;

Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  s.name        = &quot;lorem&quot;
  s.version     = Lorem::VERSION
  s.platform    = Gem::Platform::RUBY
  s.authors     = [&quot;TODO: Write your name&quot;]
  s.email       = [&quot;TODO: Write your email address&quot;]
  s.homepage    = &quot;&quot;
  s.summary     = %q{TODO: Write a gem summary}
  s.description = %q{TODO: Write a gem description}

  s.rubyforge_project = &quot;lorem&quot;

  s.files         = `git ls-files`.split(&quot;\n&quot;)
  s.test_files    = `git ls-files -- &crarr;
    {test,spec,features}/*`.split(&quot;\n&quot;)
  s.executables   = `git ls-files -- bin/*`.split(&quot;\n&quot;).map{ &crarr;
    |f| File.basename(f) }
  s.require_paths = [&quot;lib&quot;]
end</pre>

<p>We can see straight away by looking at the TODO items that this file is designed to be edited directly. Once we complete these items we&rsquo;ll have a working Gemspec file. One interesting part of this file are the file attributes towards the end of the file. Each of these is determined at runtime by using the <code>git ls-files</code> command by using git to determine the files that will be included in the gem and this is why <code>bundle gem</code> creates a git repository. The good thing about this is that it will automatically inherit the behaviour of the <code>.gitignore</code> file so that temporary files and the files we don&rsquo;t want in our git repository (and therefore don&rsquo;t want in our gem) are excluded. The defaults above will work for most gems but they can always be edited if we need different behaviour.</p>

<p>Another thing to note is how the version number is determined. This is defined as a constant called <code>Lorem::VERSION</code> and this value is defined in another file called <code>version.rb</code> in the <code>lib/lorem</code> directory. All this file does is define the version number.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/lib/lorem/version.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">module Lorem
  VERSION = &quot;0.0.1&quot;
end</pre>

<p>When it&rsquo;s time to update our gem to a new version we can change the version number here and republish the gem.</p>

<p>The other file generated in the <code>lib</code> directory is called <code>lorem.rb</code> and it&rsquo;s this file that&rsquo;s loaded when someone <code>require</code>s our gem. We can put any code we like in this file or create other files in the <code>lib</code> directory and <code>require</code> them here. For our simple Lorem gem we&rsquo;ll just create a class method called <code>ipsum</code> that returns some Lorem Ipsum text.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/lib/lorem.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">module Lorem
  def self.ipsum
    &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing ....&quot;
  end
end</pre>

<h3>Publishing</h3>

<p>So, we&rsquo;ve finished our gem now and we&rsquo;re ready to publish the first version. Before we do we&rsquo;ll update the Gemspec file and replace the TODO text.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/lorem.gemspec</p>
<pre class="ruby"># -*- encoding: utf-8 -*-
$:.push File.expand_path(&quot;../lib&quot;, __FILE__)
require &quot;lorem/version&quot;

Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  s.name        = &quot;lorem&quot;
  s.version     = Lorem::VERSION
  s.platform    = Gem::Platform::RUBY
  s.authors     = [&quot;Eifion Bedford&quot;]
  s.email       = [&quot;eifion@asciicasts.com&quot;]
  s.homepage    = &quot;&quot;
  s.summary     = %q{Lorem ipsum generator}
  s.description = %q{Simply generates lorem ipsum text.}

  s.rubyforge_project = &quot;lorem&quot;

  s.files         = `git ls-files`.split(&quot;\n&quot;)
  s.test_files    = `git ls-files -- {test,spec,features}/*`.split(&quot;\n&quot;)
  s.executables   = `git ls-files -- bin/*`.split(&quot;\n&quot;).map{ |f| File.basename(f) }
  s.require_paths = [&quot;lib&quot;]
end</pre>

<p>Then we can run the <code>gem build</code> command and point it to our Gemspec file.</p>

 
<pre class="terminal">$ gem build lorem.gemspec 
WARNING:  no homepage specified
  Successfully built RubyGem
  Name: lorem
  Version: 0.0.1
  File: lorem-0.0.1.gem</pre>
  
<p>This command generates a <code>.gem</code> file. If we were to run the <code>gem push</code> command now that would push the gem up to RubyGems.org and publish it so that others could install it.</p>

<h3>Updating</h3>

<p>It really is that easy to publish a gem with a Gemspec file. When we want to release a new version then we make the necessary changes to the code and then update the version number in <code>version.rb</code>.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/lib/lorem/version.rb</p>
<pre class="ruby">module Lorem
  VERSION = &quot;0.0.2&quot;
end</pre>

<p>We can then do a <code>gem build</code> and <code>gem push</code> again to build and publish the new version.</p>

<h3>Gemfile and Rakefile</h3>

<p>There are two more files that Bundler generated for us that we&rsquo;ve not yet covered, the <code>Gemfile</code> and the <code>Rakefile</code>. We&rsquo;ll look at the <code>Gemfile</code> first. In a Rails application the <code>Gemfile</code> manages gem dependencies with Bundler. If we look inside this <code>Gemfile</code> we&rsquo;ll see that it has just one command: <code>gemspec</code>.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/Gemfile</p>
<pre class="ruby">source &quot;http://rubygems.org&quot;

# Specify your gem&#x27;s dependencies in lorem.gemspec
gemspec</pre>

<p>This command will look inside the gem&rsquo;s Gemspec file for the gem&rsquo;s dependencies and load them through Bundler and generally we don&rsquo;t need to worry about managing this file directly. It&rsquo;s better to manage the gem&rsquo;s dependencies inside the Gemspec file and let Bundler load them automatically through the <code>Gemfile</code>. For example let&rsquo;s say that we want to use RSpec to test this gem. Instead of adding a reference to RSpec in the <code>Gemfile</code> we&rsquo;ll add it as a development dependency in <code>lorem.gemspec</code>.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with managing a Gemspec file then it&rsquo;s well worth taking a look at the <a href="http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/20#dependencies">documentation</a>. The documentation lists the various methods you can call inside the Gemspec for setting various attributes, including an <code>add_development_dependency</code> method which is want we want to use for adding RSpec.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/lorem.gemspec</p>
<pre class="ruby"># -*- encoding: utf-8 -*-
$:.push File.expand_path(&quot;../lib&quot;, __FILE__)
require &quot;lorem/version&quot;

Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  s.add_development_dependency &quot;rspec&quot;
  # Other attributes omitted
end</pre>

<p>As the Gemspec file is referenced through the <code>Gemfile</code> we can run <code>bundle</code> to ensure that we have all the required gems installed.</p>

<pre class="terminal">$ bundle
Fetching source index for http://rubygems.org/
Using diff-lcs (1.1.2) 
Using lorem (0.0.1) from source at /Users/eifion/Desktop/Dropbox/rails/apps_for_asciicasts/ep245/lorem 
Installing rspec-core (2.3.1) 
Installing rspec-expectations (2.3.0) 
Installing rspec-mocks (2.3.0) 
Installing rspec (2.3.0) 
Using bundler (1.0.7) 
Your bundle is complete! It was installed into /Users/eifion/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p0</pre>

<p>This is useful because when we publish the gem and have other developers contribute to it we can instruct them in the README file to run the <code>bundle</code> command to get the environment and all of the dependencies set up.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s the <code>Gemfile</code> but what about the <code>Rakefile</code>, why does Bundler generate that? If we take a look at it we&rsquo;ll see that it adds some gem helper tasks from Bundler.</p>

<p class="codeFilePath">/Rakefile</p>
<pre class="ruby">require &#x27;bundler&#x27;
Bundler::GemHelper.install_tasksWe can take a look at those tasks by running rake -T.
$ rake -T
(in /Users/eifion/code/ep245/lorem)
rake build    # Build lorem-0.0.2.gem into the pkg directory
rake install  # Build and install lorem-0.0.2.gem into system gems
rake release  # Create tag v0.0.2 and build 
              # and push lorem-0.0.2.gem to Rubygems</pre>
              
<p>The code in the <code>Rakefile</code> generates three tasks. These are convenience tags for the common tasks of building, installing and releasing the gem. A common workflow is to call <code>rake install</code> when a gem is set up the way we want so that we can install it  on our local machine and test it out fully and then call <code>rake release</code> to tag that release and publish the gem to RubyGems.</p>

<h3>Updating Existing Gems</h3>

<p>Bundler provides a pretty nice way to set up a gem from scratch but what if we have an existing gem that we&rsquo;d like to apply this workflow to? It&rsquo;s easy to apply this technique to an existing gem by copy over some of the files. The files that need to be copied are the <code>Gemfile</code>, the <code>.gemspec</code> file and the <code>Rakefile</code> if you want the rake tasks that it provides. Adding those files to any existing gem will enable us to use this same workflow to any existing gems. </p>

<p>Overall Bundler is a great solution for creating and managing gems. It&rsquo;s much simpler than the other tools we&rsquo;ve covered in previous episodes so it&rsquo;s well worth considering when you&rsquo;re creating any new gems.</p>
